# Idea
Small spotify/apple music icon hovers in top right corner of web browser. When clicked runs Shazam like system to determine what if any song is being played on the current viewed webpage. Once song is determined search music service for that song. Provide user with dropdown menu of their playlists underneath the icon button in top left. User can then select what playlists they would like to add the song to making sure not to add duplicate songs to playlists.

Additional Possibility:

If song does not exist on platform download song and store locally on device then add to playlist.
