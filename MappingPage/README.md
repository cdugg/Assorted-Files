Note:
This is all my first attempt at using JavaScript which is not something I have ever been taught.

Other files needed:

# js folder
jquery.js

leaflet.js

leaflet-src.esm.js

leaflet-src.js

three.js

# Base folder
leaflet.css

# CSS folder
leaflet.js.map

leaflet-src.esm.ja.map

leaflet-src.js.map

# Images
Nonplaceholders for all mappings

---------------------------------------------

Map style currently not being used but makes map tiles a greyscale style

Current map style uses mapbox

# Intended Improvements
Download map tiles and host locally to avoid using mapbox

Use Map style file to style tiles instead of using mapbox

Optimization

Make script.js much more legible

# Other Ideas for Improvement
Create 3d environment with movable camera and interactive features ie selectable buildings or map features that provide further detail on the selected item. For simple sample see:
