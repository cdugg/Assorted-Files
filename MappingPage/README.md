Note:
This is all my first attempt at using JavaScript which is not something I have ever been taught.

Other files needed:

# js folder
jquery.js

leaflet.js

leaflet-src.esm.js

leaflet-src.js

three.js

# Base folder
leaflet.css

# CSS folder
leaflet.js.map

leaflet-src.esm.ja.map

leaflet-src.js.map

# Images
Nonplaceholders for all mappings

---------------------------------------------

Map style currently not being used but makes map tiles a greyscale style

Current map style uses mapbox

# Intended Improvements
Download map tiles and host locally to avoid using mapbox

Use Map style file to style tiles instead of using mapbox

Optimization

Make script.js much more legible
